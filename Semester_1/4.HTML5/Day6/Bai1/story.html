          <p>
            What is the one philosophy that drives SCAAL? We believe that no
            matter where you go, you should always be able to enjoy the simple
            pleasure of a good cup of coffee in a comfortable environment. At
            home, reading the morning paper. At your local SCAAL, conversing
            with a confidant. Or perhaps in some foreign land, SCAAL will be
            greeting you like an old friend. After all, coffee is a ritual that
            transcends all cultural boundaries. It makes us feel alert,
            energetic and alive.
          </p>
          <h2>Where we began</h2>
          <p>
            Anders Carlsson lived a sheltered life in a small fishing village in
            Marstrand, Sweden. As a child, he listened to stories of his
            grandfather Olaf’s adventures and expeditions. Often his grandfather
            would bring back exotic coffees for the family to enjoy. Upon his
            graduation Anders left home to see the world. He worked all kinds of
            odd jobs. He worked in Parisian cafes and Italian espresso bars. He
            worked in the coffee fields of Brazil and New Guinea. And in a few
            years, Anders learned the art of selecting the perfect coffee bean
            and roasting it to perfection. He returned home in 1990 to open the
            first SCAAL in Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his own unique blends
            of coffee and a stimulating atmosphere, SCAAL quickly became the
            place to gather – day or night – not only in Stockholm, Sweden, but
            670 cities around the world.
          </p>
          <h2>What makes SCAAL the best coffee?</h2>
          <p>
            Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned as an apprentice in
            the coffee fields to every buyer, roaster, and franchise owner.
            SCAAL’s standards for coffee are never compromised. We only select
            SHB – strictly hard bean or strictly high grown – coffee beans. To
            ensure their flavorful oils are preserved, extraordinary steps are
            taken to protect the coffee bean from heat, light, air and moisture.
            All these efforts are made so that we may offer you the perfect cup
            of coffee. There are so many places you could go to buy coffee.
            We’ve gone to extraordinary efforts to ensure that SCAAL is your
            best choice.
          </p>

            The quality at harvest SCAAL relies on selective picking, a
            labor-intensive process that involves cutting several passes among
            the trees for those cherries that are perfectly ripe. Then we select
            top grade SHB, which stands for strictly hard bean or strictly high
            grown. Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet
            above sea level for optimum flavor. Within hours of shipping our
            coffee to you, the beans are roasted on-site in small batches by a
            Certified Roastmaster and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh taste
            and rich aroma.
